## Here is the Magic 🌟

Below you will find some of the projects I have been very passionate about at various points in my coding journey. From applying machine learning to deck builders ([Slay-I](https://github.com/alexdriedger/SlayTheSpireFightPredictor)), to helping students find free food at university ([Scavenge](https://github.com/alexdriedger/ReactFood)), to replacing text in a video game with emojis ([EmojiMod](https://github.com/alexdriedger/EmojiMod)), hopefully this collection of projects shows my creative side.

All of the projects below have fairly in-depth READMEs, but are written in a way to be approachable to everyone.

## Slay the Spire Mods

[Slay the Spire](https://www.megacrit.com/) is a rougelike deck builder and is one of my favorite games of all time. I have published 3 mods on Steam, with over 13,000 downloads combined.

### 🤖 [Slay-I](https://github.com/alexdriedger/SlayTheSpireFightPredictor)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🤖 Slay-I uses deep neural networks to predict the damage a player will take in a fight in Slay the Spire

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🤖 Evaluates adding, removing, and upgrading cards in a player's deck

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✍ I wrote a [Medium article in Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/bringing-deep-neural-networks-to-slay-the-spire-a2971d5a5115?sk=4161df5a0f41ede5c68c81d6a0651aaf), which dives into the design of Slay-I
